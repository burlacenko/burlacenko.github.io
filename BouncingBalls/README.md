<h1>BouncingBall Project for <strong>MIT Web Development in JavaScript</strong></h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an <em>exercise</em> to practice Web Development in JavaScript

<h2>Installation</h2>
Open <strong>bouncingball.html</strong> in the browser

<h2>Usage</h2>
The first ball will be randomly and automatically created. As it bounces at the edges of the screen, it will produce a new one and so on. Three buttons are available so far:
<ul>
<li><strong>Click me</strong> for a Hello World message</li>
<li><strong>Kill one ball</strong> to kill the last ball created. Caution: if you kill the first ball, none will be left, forcing you to reset</li>
<li><strong>Reset</strong> to clear and restart (at a higher speed)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>click or touch a ball to destroy it</li>
<li>after reaching ball limit (100), start to change theis sizes</li>
</ul>
