# Bouncing Balls Exercise
>MIT Web Development in JavaScript as part of MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development</h1>

<h2>Title Description</h2>
<p>This is an <em>exercise</em> to practice Web Development in JavaScript</p>
<p>Color balls will bounce on the screen and multiply as they hit the edges of the page. The first ball will be randomly and automatically created. As it bounces at the edges of the screen, it will produce a new one and so on. Three buttons are available so far:
<ul>
<li><strong>Click me</strong> for a Hello World message</li>
<li><strong>Kill one ball</strong> to kill the last ball created. Caution: if you kill the first ball, none will be left, forcing you to reset</li>
<li><strong>Reset</strong> to clear and restart (at a higher speed)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>How To Run</h2>
<p>To try a live version, click <a href="https://burlacenko.github.io/BouncingBalls/bouncingball.html">here</a>. To try it locally, fork and clone the project and then open <strong>bouncingball.html</strong> in the browser.
</p>

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Click or touch a ball to destroy it</li>
<li>After reaching ball limit (100), start to change theis sizes</li>
</ul>
</p>
