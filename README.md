## Description
This repository contains some of my experiences in progress during this MIT program.
The <a href="https://burlacenko.github.io/index.html">landing page</a> contains a short profile page and links to part of the course exercises.
Each project page show a description of the exercise and some remarks about a few ideas added to each one. Each of them will also contain instructions on how to test it and some grounds for future improvements, plus a link to a live version of the project.
