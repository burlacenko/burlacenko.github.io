# PacMen Exercise
>MIT Web Development in JavaScript as part of MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development</h1>

## Title Description
This is an <em>exercise</em> to practice Web Development in JavaScript where a PacMen factory is created to programmatically multiply elements in the DOM, triggered by the click of a button. Each of them will move about the browser window at their own pace.

Additions made to the original exercise:

- [x] PacMen `bounce` off any wall it hits
- [x] Added a `click` property to each PacMan
- [x] Click the PacMan to `reverse` its direction
- [x] Click to `kill` the PacMan</li>
- [x] Added a `Reset` button to Kill All and stop the game
	
## How to Run
To try a live version, click <a href="https://burlacenko.github.io/PacMen/index.html">here</a>. To try it locally, fork and clone the project and then open <strong>index.html</strong> in the browser.
To start movement click at least once on "Add PacMan" button to create new PacMen. New PacMen can be created at any time.
Click on "Start" to make them move

## Roadmap of future improvements:

- [ ] display a beautiful popup or tooptip message when mouse hovering a PacMan
- [ ] use new images for up and down movement
- [ ] accept keyboard arrow inputs
- [ ] draw a maze
- [ ] place cookies to be eaten by PacMan
- [ ] bring in some ghosts
