# PacMen Exercise
>MIT Web Development in JavaScript as part of MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development</h1>

<h2>Title Description</h2>
This is an <em>exercise</em> to practice Web Development in JavaScript where a PacMen factory is created to programmatically multiply elements in the DOM, triggered by the click of a button. Each of them will move about the browser window at their own pace.

<h2>How to Run</h2>
To try a live version, click <a href="https://burlacenko.github.io/PacMen/index.html">here</a>. To try it locally, fork and clone the project and then open <strong>index.html</strong> in the browser.
To start movement simply click on the PacMan
Click on "Add PacMan" button to create new PacMen. New PacMen can be created at any time.
Click on "Start" to make them move
