<h1>Real Time Bus Tracker</h1>
<h2>Project for <strong>Part 1: Web Development with JavaScript</h2>
<h2>MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN June 2021</h2>


<h2>Description</h2>
This is an <em>exercise</em> to practice Web Development in JavaScript and it displays some city buses locations in real-time.
Additions to the original exercise:
<ul>
<li>Identify the actual address of the buses given their coordinates (longitude and latitude)</li>
<li>A marker for each bus location with a PopUp being presented when a marker is clicked</li>
<li>Each PopUp will show the bus line, its current stop sequence and the current address.</li>
<li>Each marker color shows the bus occupancy status:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Green: many seats available</li>
	<li>Red: few seats available</li>
	<li>Blue: occupancy unknown</li>
	</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Open <strong>index.html</strong> in the browser

<h2>Usage</h2>
The first ball will be randomly and automatically created. As it bounces at the edges of the screen, it will produce a new one and so on. Three buttons are available so far:
<ul>
<li><strong>Click me</strong> for a Hello World message</li>
<li><strong>Kill one ball</strong> to kill the last ball created. Caution: if you kill the first ball, none will be left, forcing you to reset</li>
<li><strong>Reset</strong> to clear and restart (at a higher speed)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>click or touch a ball to destroy it</li>
<li>after reaching ball limit (100), start to change theis sizes</li>
</ul>
