<h1>Real Time Bus Tracker</h1>
<h2>Project for <strong>Part 1: Web Development with JavaScript</h2>
<h2>MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN June 2021</h2>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is an <em>exercise</em> to practice Web Development in JavaScript and it displays some city buses locations at Boston in real-time.</p>
<p>Additions made to the original exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>It now identifies the current address of the buses given their coordinates (longitude and latitude)</li>
<li>A marker is plotted for all buses in service</li>
<li>A PopUp was added to show information about that bus when a marker is clicked:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Bus Line Number</li>
	<li>Current Stop Sequence</li>
	<li>Current Address</li>
	</ol>
<li>Each PopUp will show the bus line, its current stop sequence and the current address</li>
<li>Marker color shows the bus occupancy status:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Green: many seats available</li>
	<li>Red: few seats available</li>
	<li>Blue: occupancy unknown</li>
	</ol>
</ul>

<h2>How to Run</h2>
Open <strong>index.html</strong> in the browser

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A button to toggle "show all" / "hide all" permanent ballons with each bus information</li>
<li>Select one bus to be followed (map will keep centering at selected bus)</li>
<li>Add a combo box to list all availble routes</li>
<li>Draw a line showing the full route</li>
<li>Change the icon of the bus rotating it accordingly to its current direction</li>
</ul>
