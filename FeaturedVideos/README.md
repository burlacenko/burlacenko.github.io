# Featured Videos React Exercise
>MIT Web Development in JavaScript as part of MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN June 2021

## Title Description
This is a coding <em>challenge</em> to practice Front-End Development with React and ES6 for data fetching. It is intented to create a simple React app to fetch, manipulate and render data. For this purpose, I chose the themoviedb.org API, which provides information on movies and series among other stuff.

## How to Run
To try a live version, click <a href="https://burlacenko.github.io/FeaturedVideos/index.html">here</a>. To try it locally, fork and clone the project and then open <strong>index.html</strong> in the browser.

## Features
Project was created from scratch with these original features:

- [x] random data is fetched from the API
- [x] when page is reloaded, fetching and rendering new images and facts
  
## Roadmap of future improvements
- [ ] auto reload to make it like a "slide show"
- [ ] allow users to pause the "slide show"
- [ ] allow users to make it slower or faster
